		<h3><span style="color: #000080;">LATEST CHANGELOGs:</span></h3>
		<div class="lingulo-accordion">
			<div>
					<h4>Update 3.43 (30h October 2017) - REUPLOADED - IMPORTANT UPDATE</h4>
					<br/>- Please reload an external XML (english or other) to refresh the language of the game! Use the ones in my <a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/ivanaedler/MIMPUT/" target="_blank">GITHUB</a>. Or you can just click RESET SAVES in the first screen if you dont have saved games and you dont want to mess around the XML files (English only!)
					<br/>- NEW: Bowser Jr scene! To see it, you have to lose all of your lives, then go to the prison for at least 2 times. He might appear in future 'gameovers' there. This scene is also in the Bowser gallery
					<br/>- NEW: Now you can zoom in the gallery! Just select a given scene, then click in any area of the scene. There are 4 zoom modes. If you click more than 3 times, it will go back to default zoom.
					<br/>- ADDED Bobomb Buddy and Luigi scenes to the Friends gallery
					<br/>- ADDED Luma scene 3 to the game (it had only two in the game, but all three in the gallery). Just talk to Lumas and select option 3.
					<br/>- Rule change: Bowser scene in the prison will now happen if you visit there three times. He might appear in future visits there.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Bowser gallery scene was not working anymore
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Music in 1-5 sometimes is duplicated with another song when the princess loses a life or went underwater
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: sometimes in the worldmap, the princess with a chainball was locking herself up (not being possible to move anymore)
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: the checkpoint in levels like 1-1 was not working as a checkpoint (the princess was returning to the start of the level upon losing a lie)
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: when going to bonus toad house level, a blueprint was being shown in the level loading screen, but there isnt any in that level!
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: certain koopalings (bosses) not advancing during scenes, like Ludwig and Wendy, as well as certain enemy scenes like the 5th chuck scene.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: certain Anuboos and 'laid goombas' are with reversed text balloons.
					<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
					<h4>Update 3.42 (24h October 2017)</h4>
					<br/>- NEW: Bobomb Buddy scene. To see it, you have to stomp him, then return to the Bunker (he will be angry)
					<br/>- NEW: In 1-3 level, the toad says you need to fuck the goomba to get the key. If you agree, but you kill a goomba instead (by stomping him, for example), the toad will argue about it. If you lie and he discovers it, he will be sad and he might order you to suck his dick in order not to tell Toadsworth. The other way around will also get a scene, in the case you tell the toad you rather kill him, but end up with a sex scene with the goomba. Idea by Peterpeterpeter and HappyGoomba.
					<br/>- BUG FIX: Poochy scene in the gallery wasnt working.
					<br/>- BUG FIX: Gallery 'Other Enemies' not working (can't click in any scene button)
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: In Daisy palace, Daisy was still being exchanged to the playable character (like a 'selfish scene').
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Playing as Krystal, a given Daisy scene in her palace (when she sats on Daisy's lap) was without her blue tail
					<br/>- Glitch Fix (technical): Some improvements with 'checkCh(obj,null,false)' was not working well since July 2017. Rollback to checkCh(obj,"Daisy") and other players manually.
					<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
					<h4>Update 3.41 (17h October 2017)</h4>
					<br/>- NEW: A punishment if you refuse the princess to remove her clothes if she is eager to do (happens in situations like when she is a nymph or slut in heat). There are 4 types of punishment if you press 'no': The timer advances 50 seconds, you got dizzy for some time, creatures will walk/run faster until the end of the level, and you will slip down (like walking over a puddle of cum).
					<br/>- Rule Change: the pink dress (located in Peach's closet) will reappear again only if you finish a given world.
					<br/>- Improvement to gallery code (tech info: instances of scene main casted dynamically)
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: lack of neck in some backside poses, like when descending the finish pole as Peachy character
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: the shygirl behind the lemonade stand looks like the princess in a shygirl outfit. She had no green hair as before. The same with Daisy in 2-6 level (dry dry land).
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: not really a glitch, but some people didnt like her 'always opened' mouth as Peachy character, like in frontside pose. After some seconds she will close her mouth.
					<br/>- Other small fixes, like adjustments to her boobies in backside pose. her washing hand that was trespassing her large breasts during bath, inverted eyes in some poses (tech info: the usage of "liddedright","liddedright", as the new eye setup due to new Peachy dont support those combinations like that anymore), etc.
					<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
					<h4>Update 3.40 (14h October 2017)</h4>
					Three months without an update. This has several reasons: my late vacation + some hard-to-fix-bugs + improvements + personal problems (hope all is now okay to keep going).
					<br/>- NEW SCENE: Luigi gloryhole scene made by Blargh! In order to see it, you have to search for a... 'stinky/not in order toilet' in 6-4 (Delfino Island world)
					<br/>- NEW: Princesses Gangbang scene, made by me, idea from ShadowFox! It is the most complex scene to date! You can get it if you fuck Daisy, then Wendy, then you return to your castle and sit in Peach's bed. If you're Daisy, the option wont be available (I plan making the scene work with other princesses, so when Rosalina is available as a NPC, you will be able to fuck her as Daisy, then go to this gangbang scene). You must NOT beat Wendy (by stomping her) in her airship, or you wont see it!
					<br/>- NEW: 'Princess in the Prison' achievement by TripFlip. In order to see it, you need to be fucked by a guard in a gangbang way, that is, if a goomba opens the door, and the scene is the gangbang one (3 goombas). The same with other creatures there.
					<br/>- NEW: 'Princesses and Wendy' achievement by TripFlip. In order to see it, you need to fuck Daisy, then Wendy, then fuck them all in a gangbang scene in her bedroom.
					<br/>- NEW: 'Less Belly' button during showers, like checkpoint showers, tube baths and pools. Now you can decrease her belly there. If Allow Farting is ON, you will hear fart sounds. This button WONT decrease her belly if Peach is already with default Belly, or if her MINIMUM Belly is already big, or if pregnant.
					<br/>- NEW: 'Burn Off' button during shower. It will appear if you're a Fire Peach or a Fire Peach PS. It will return you to normal Peach.
					<br/>- NEW: You can press LEFT and RIGHT during shower/bath scenes to select a given button, then just press space. So you dont need the mouse in those scenes anymore.
					<br/>- NEW Option: 'Bigger Belly when' (single button that changes its text): none, eating, pregnancy, creatures, or all. If you choose any option while pregnant, you will still be pregnant. If 'none' is selected, this will only make your belly at 'min belly size' at all times. If you choose eating, it will only grow when eating certain fruits, and so on.
					<br/>- NEW: 'Call a Toad' option when the princess is sat down in her bed. IN PROGRESS yet (but well it's there so I'll urge myself to make it fully)!
					<br/>- NEW: 'Asshole swollen till...' option, so you can choose the number of days for it to be back to normal (1,2,3,5,10, and 'NEVER')
					<br/>- IMPROVED shower balloons of text. Instead of buttons, you can click right in the names. More room for more buttons!
					<br/>- IMPROVED gravity check for 'hurting the princess' when creatures are falling off grounds (tech info: GRAV 2)
					<br/>- FASTER 'kick' shells
					<br/>- Rule Change: The princess wont lose her asshole status when losing a life, as you now can choose the number of days for it to be back to normal.
					<br/>- Rule Change: Now, creatures will only harm the princess (when falling down while hitting her) in hard game mode. People are complaining that, in normal game, they were being hurt in a way it's harder to avoid.
					<br/>- Rule Change: Now, when going to worldmap, it wont count +1 day. Its like the princess has plenty of time (before or after a level) to do something else before the day ends. This makes the 'day count' better, as it should count in each adventure (in each level). This also avoids problems like 'only having odd numbers' when going to worldmap, then going back to another level.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: The princess was starting the level with a dress (skirt, vest, shoulder top and bra), but she was supposed to be with lingerie only. Also, when losing a life, she remained with her entire pink dress.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: 'Press to Interact' blue button not disappearing after the princess gets into her bath (like in her Castle)
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: the princess was not sleeping anymore after laying down in her bath (when you press 'lay' button).
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: 'vanilla peach' leg in Krystal character.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: when Wario was naked in some bars, he was regaining clothes in the end of his scene.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: in some toilets behind closed doors, like in 6-4 level (Delfino), even if the princess opens the door, she couldn't use the toilet (Tech info: state needs to be Dict.opened, not "opened")
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: when you configured her Belly in the options (say, to be 'always Bigger'), she was not respecting this in the beginning of the game (only if you lose a life).
					<br/>- Other minor changes, like more room for Achievement screen buttons, and new XML tags, like ALWAYS and SOMETIMES.
					<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
					<h4>Update 3.39 (11h July 2017)</h4>
					<br/>- NEW: Luma scene 3 by Blargh! Also, added all the three Lumas scenes to 'Friends' Gallery.
					<br/>- NEW: A REAL ponytail to Peachy! (like when Peach is playing in a tennis court). You can change her ponytail style (normal or ponytail) in her drawer next to her bathroom (you will see a 'MAKEUP' text in the drawer). If ponytail was selected, this hair state will only change back to normal if you get a Shadow Queen outfit.
					<br/>- NEW: You can change other princesses' NPC belly and boobs in the Options (below Boobies/Belly header)! Daisy, Rosalina, Shygirl, Mona and Pauline are there (only Daisy and Shygirl is available so far).
					<br/>- IMPROVED classic masturbation. No more 'two masturbation types' at random. Now, every time you press the masturbation key or if she does it automatically when a nymph, she will engage on it by those rules: If NOT a nymph, or NOT horny enough, she will start by looking left/right (as she is embarrassed). If she is Daisy, or already a nymph, but not horny enough, she will tenderly touch her insides, touching/rubbing them a bit, then sniffing it. If horny enough (say, 50%), she will engage in a more directly masturbation (the classic one we know since the early versions), until falling while cumming. No more 'dumb/slow sniffing alternative pose', where the player used to get annoyed because she do it slow in order to cum, and with just two repetitive loops. Before, we needed to press the masturbation button again and again until getting the classic masturbation action.
					<br/>- Rule Change: when taking a new powerup, the princess wont have her (erhm) little perverted asshole back to normal anymore (if swollen due to sex). You have to lose a life to get it back.
					<br/>- Rule Change: instead of 'Fart Sounds' in the options, we have 'Allow Farting': ON/OFF. OFF as default. If ON, fart sounds will also be enabled. Also, the farting will only happen if she is stopped (that is, just standing up).
					<br/>- Rule Change: tail attacks (as a leaf or pure raccoon) wont lock you anymore. If you do the attack, she will do the move, but you can interrupt her just by pressing any key.
					<br/>- Glitch FIX: the vineblock of 7-1 level (cloud area) was not so easily activated depending on the princess restriction to jumping (like when pregnant), making the player use a leaf to get to the green pipe.
					<br/>- Glitch FIX: a bit of wrong color tone in the new Peach character (Peachy)
					<br/>- Glitch FIX: the princess was not 'changing her belly' in certain scenes. Strangely, the belly only 'updated' itself later.
					<br/>- Glitch FIX: Rosalina without a 'front hand' in certain scenes, like when she falls down (when losing a life)
					<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
					<h4>Update 3.38 (28h June 2017)</h4>
					- NEW! The so awaited NEW PEACH MODEL from TripFlip! Her name is Peachy and she is the default character from now on. If you want the playshapes or aedler Peach versions, they are (and will) still be available. Just change her character when playing a new game (or use the cheat code to change her character in the OUTFIT screen)! Well, I cant guarantee she is 100% free of glitches for now, but I tested her a lot before releasing her. No Fire Peachy available (and I may not make her until finishing all the worlds and other features first).
					<br/>- IMPROVED princess character models in the character select screen (they were 'faded' due to some problems vectorizing from GIMP).
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: the princess was being able to masturbate in hard mode.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: In the cataquack scene, a new action/loop where the princess goes up and down, facing us when fucked, was not appearing anymore. Also, her boob nipples were still appearing when se cums.
					<br/>- Small fixes like a typo in the gallery for Ninjis: the 'ASS STAR ATTACK' can also be vaginal, depending on her state, so the name is now just 'STAR ATTACK'.
					<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
					<h4>Update 3.37 (8h June 2017)</h4>
					<br/>- Rule Change: when saving to Clipboard, you can copy to an external TXT file as before, but now, it wont overwrite to ANY SAVED SLOT in the game. It will load it back but the game wont have a new saved slot. If you have 2 saved slots before, it will be still be 2 (untouched). If you dont have any saved game, it will still be empty. Just SAVE the loaded game in a given slot you want.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: when the princess are removing her clothes in the level, like when she is a nymph enough to do it (or if you click in her current powerup icon in the top-left of the HUD), if any enemy captures her, she stops removing her clothes all of a sudden to do a lasvicious act. Also, it was making her remove her clothes twice, and the pink message box with 'The princess removed her clothes' werent disappearing in the end.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: In the HARD game mode, the LAST scene of any enemy were not being used anymore. As creatures can fuck her in random order, the last one werent being taken in account. More tests needs (mainly for Drybones)
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: when the princess got a swollen asshole, she was not returning it to normal when losing a life or by taking a powerup.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: now you can save to the clipboard if you havent any saved slot yet (like in the beginning of the game).
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: IN HARD GAME MODE, if you are in the Bonus Toad house and you talk with lumas and choice any option, inmediatly you were going out of the level.
					<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
					<h4>Update 3.36 (30h May 2017)</h4>
					<br/>- NEW scene: Jabbi 3 (gangbang)! It's also in the gallery ('Other Enemies' button). If during the scene an 'error in XML' shows up, or the balloons act strangely, please remember to reload an updated XML in my github site or click in RESET SAVES in the loader screen.
					<br/>- Improved CatSuit powerup model (based on Mario games): a golden bell instead of the icon of a pink catsuit in Peach character.
					<br/>- Rule Change: If the princess touches a grounded creature that is jumping or falling (e.g. goomba), she will be hurt. Just beware when you walk around areas where creatures might fall from platforms above you.
					<br/>- Text Fix: Changed 'Doggy AnalStyle' to 'Doggy In Pussy' in Koopa gallery. This never was an anal scene.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: a given toad scene in 6-2 level with 'XML ERROR'
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Toad scene 8 was being counted as VAGINAL, but its ANAL.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: CatSuit powerup not going to the inventory
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: When using an inventory item in the worldmap, the princess was not updating her outfit correctly (the player needed to move her).
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Mushroom dicks scene (like near Mario Pad level), and Bowser scene (during the prison) were not counting as a 'new sex scene', giving the 'still a virgin' glitch.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: When a given goomba (e.g. with spikes) appeared from a hole, a different one (e.g. goombario) spawed instead.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: wrong 4-4 music in certain places, like a grey pipe (it was playing 'mario underwater music').
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Jabbis (the 'flies') where going up until disappearing.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: The green blob creature and boos were not appearing in certain levels like 7-6. This occurred at random. (tech info: problem was the Foreground layer with foreign objects)
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: during the JellyFish sisters scene, the princess got her asshole 'swollen' (but they havent 'fucked' it).
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: The princess was regaining her garters and stockings (what?) after certain scenes. Tech info:  'frame 0 STOP! instead of 4' (F0SI4 or 'FOSIA') syndrome in those outfit mcs. And the fact those are integers, not "None" String checks anymore in removeHeels() and other functions.
					<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
					<h4>Update 3.35 (21th May 2017)</h4>
					- Feature: Now you can use one of the sewer pipes to go to a given world you visited at least once with the cannon. If not, the princess will just go outside (Red Pipe).
					<br/>- RULE CHANGE: in HARD GAME mode, if she has 80% or more (horniness), the princess will be dizzy for a while.
					<br/>- ADDED a message 'Error in XML' in the INTRO screen, just in case something is wrong with the file you are trying to load up. Sometimes, XML can get corrupted in my github site. You can check if people are updating them without errors by copying all the XML file and pasting in http://www.xmlvalidation.com.
					<br/>- BUG FIX: when the princess threw a given object, like shells or a pow block in levels like 5-6, she was freezing up!
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: if 'ALWAYS A NYMPH' Personality option is set, she was still 'shaking herself with her hand in her head' when she stops walking.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: when time is up, a creature was appearing all of a sudden during another creature action on the princess. Actually, the creature should only appear if the princess is 'available'.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: when you set a custom DRESS Powerup in the OUTFIT screen, then you restart the game, the princess was in her bed with that outfit. Actually, the princess should be with her dress, as she returned from the train like this.
					<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
					<h4>Update 3.34 (17th May 2017)</h4>
					- NEW: Level 8-2 (underground level). It's a new themed level (it's not a level based on another). Some new textures. There are also interesting features like the rotate platforms and the crushing trunks.
					<br/>- NEW cheat codes: 'HOLD 1, then left or right' to change outfits, and 'HOLD Y, then press 3' to be pregnant. You need to activate the master cheat first (1 and 0).
					<br/>- NEW: 'Load Game' and 'Options' buttons in the intro screen!
					<br/>- ADDED Waluigi in some levels (tip: where he is, Wario might be with him or not), and if you are continuing the game (if you finished it at least once), they will appear all the time in the toad town bar. Waluigi can be in 'Smoothie Depot level too' (with Mona!) She's not a playable character yet. No Waluigi scenes yet.
					<br/>- Rule change: in skull rocks scene in 6-6 level, if the princess sucks their dicks 'in a non lewd way', it wont count as a sexual act (laid countdown). E.g. If its 48 left to be a pure nymph, it will remain as 48.
					<br/>- BUG FIX: In 6-4 level, in delfino streets, when using a given green pipe, the game was throwing the princess to a blue void area. Also, the trampoline wasn't working. Finally, the toads were going to the front of a wooden table in certain scenes.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: When restarting the game in certain circunstances, odd problems happened with outfits and its current situation, like shred vagina/butt areas. Tech info: 'Flags.SAVED*' not being reset in _reset().
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: When using the PANIC screen (ENTER key) if in the 'corridor pipe' area (like when using a pipe in the worldmap), the princess was reappearing in the same (or different) worldmap, but zoomed out and with some functions not working. Now she will be warped to 'peach castle campus area' if Panic Screen is used SPECIFICALLY from those specific inner level areas, as there is no way to find out which worldmap she came from (in order to return her to it).
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: In 6-4 level, XML fix in Pole scene.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: XML ERROR when loading ShyGuy village level in World 3.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: In 6-6 level, XML fix in the Flavio dialogue.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: The Princess Portrait (horny status) was something showing a wrong princess (e.g. Rosalina) than your current one (e.g. Daisy).
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: XML fix in Toad (doc or fake doc) scenes: if a normal toad, the princess was saying 'Erhm...Doc...Dont you..Ahhhh... have another way...to cure it?' instead of 'Hey...you're not a doctor! Ahhh!'
					<br/>- Small enhancements like the 'smoke animation' when changing outfits.

					<h4>Update 3.33 (10th May 2017) - SERVICE FIXES II</h4>
					- ADDED Peach Pregnancy screen in the achievement screen! If you playing a 'Peach' character, and you get pregnancy for many times, you will unlock it!
					<br/>- Rule Change: when the princess is with the slave outfit, she wont lose it part by part. It's a fixed outfit until she finds another powerup or loses a life!
					<br/>- Improvement: AN OVERHAUL of SAVE/LOAD slot system using 'Multiple Save File Approach - 'MUSAFIA'. Only the first slot is compliant with the last game versions, so you need to resave in slot 2,3,4,5 in order to retain them in your system. You can keep your first saved slot and any saved text (clipboard saved to txt files), as they will work in this version. But beware! The save to clipboard will now save to an external slot (in a text file), then if you load it, it wont recover all your slots (if your game has 0 used slots, it will still be like that). So you just save the loaded game again in a given slot you want.
					<br/>- Improvement: 'tail' bodypart is now a reference to memory. No more enterframes on it.
					<br/>- Improvement: when pressing SPACE (next key) in the character select screen, you will get the current selected princess that was made by LEFT/RIGHT keys.
					<br/>- Readjusted princess size in Monty Mole scenes (she was a bit bigger).
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Strange nipples appearing in her backside boobs (when they're large enough when the princess is facing backside) during scenes like SockHop (the green sack creature). Tech Info: 'noNipple' var cant be right in frame 1 of some scenes due to Timeline.exec mechanism + noMoreEnterFrames in objects.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: 'Toads in her table' to eat a pizza' scene: scene not happening when all toads are there due to Type Coercion error.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Luigi was not reading his book anymore
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: The princess was walking like holding a dress, after taking up the 'naked leaf' powerup.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: The princess (as a Fire princess) was jumping herself up when hitting a X-naut or a Chomp with a fireball.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: When the princess is a raccoon and falling, she only animate her tail once.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: The princess was able to 'lose a life' (DEL KEY) in the worldmap.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: When using the cannon, the world name was still 'Mushroom Kingdom' in the MENU screen, when reaching a new worldmap, like Bumpy Forest. The player needed to enter a given level, then exit it to return to the current worldmap in order to fix the world name.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: The Fire Princess (Frontside dialogue model) was not with red eyes.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Princess' earrings and crown not being removed when she undresses to take a shower. Also, she was leaving the bath stark naked, without her crown (those blue bath she can lay into (marble ones), like in Daisy palace level). Tech Info: 'noPile' returning without executing important functions.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Daisy Palace: Princess' scene with another princess (like Peach and Daisy) showing wrong hands (e.g. Daisy with a wrong Fire Peach hand).
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Daisy Palace: Princess' scene with another princess (like Peach and Daisy) making the other princess with the same eye color/style as the main character
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Daisy Palace: When Daisy was masturbating, the playable princess' horny bar was going up without the player consent.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Peach Castle level (sewers): strange 'green pipe inside another pipe' in the big upside down pipe in the sewers area of Peach's castle. (Tech info: pipe.init() happens after _level config, so we moved to pos-init).
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Peach Castle level (sewers): when the princess used one of the 8 pipes in the bottom, we couldnt use CTRL do go to the menu (strange message: "Can't go to the pause screen while entering doors or objects!")  (Tech Info: wrong 'destination="pipe_out1" which is non existant)
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Peach Castle level (sewers): when we pressed LEFT or RIGHT right after the princess returned from the sewer level (a pipe from a given worldmap, like SubCon), the level ends unexpectelly (Tech Info: Fallingpalacemaneuver_4104/frame66()[MarioisMissingPUT_fla.PZz_fallingpalacemaneuver_4104::frame66:4] still being called! Its like when finishing another airship, when returning to the sewers, the airship1 over Peach castle was making her fall that way - message Level 1-1: Config.finishedWorld is true, this happens when Peach beaten the airship some seconds before!). But THIS CAN HAPPEN when Peach returned to worldmap 3, then returned to the sewers much later!)
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Princess' Castle level: XML Error when 'talking' with the chains in her tower, and when trying to use the teleporter in 9-1 level
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: 9-1 level: XML Error when trying to use the teleporter
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: 4-4 level (Boggly Tree): XML Error when talking to the Puny Elder
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: In Toad Town, when asking Charlieton to buy something, if you do it, the coins decreases for the HUD, but slowly enough to make Charlieton say 'You dont have enough coins'. Now, you will only be able to press a given number in the dialogue if all coins were removed from the princess 'purse' (her asshole). Also, the 'coin number' animation will be smoother.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: XML Error when trying to get 'YourCumWasCleaned' message.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Princess' Castle level: The princess butt is appearing in certain short skirts in the 'side throne' scene (next to her royal table)
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: The 'Train' occurrence that the princess wrote in her diary is being kept in the diary BEFORE the Toadsworth event.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: The princess' eyes (Frontside dialogue model) was not red when the princess is a fire princess.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: The female princesses that are friend of Peach (like Daisy and the Shygirl) is with red eyes when you are playing a Fire Peach character.

		<h3><span style="color: #000080;">DISCLAIMER:</span></h3>
			-This is a XXX freeware parody game of Princess Peach (18+ only)!
			<br/>-It's always good to remember: This is a fan game inspired by PLAYSHAPES game (link <a href="http://swfchan.com/17/84872/?mario-is-missing.swf" target="_blank">HERE!</a>). Without Playshapes vanguardism, this game may never have existed!
			<br/>-This Peach game has NOTHING to do with NINTENDO! Their games are 'E' rated anyway. Although everything was created from scratch/inspired by hentai sites, the names "Princess Peach, Super Mario Bros" and other Mario characters are copyrighted by NINTENDO.
			<br/>- Now the game features 4 (FOUR) keyboard layouts. Please choose one before playing. It also has QWERTY/AZERTY options.  That's better than setting each key separatelly (a tedious process for you, and not fail-proof to be saved correctly if you turn off the computer, as flash uses internal cache in a ghost file!)
			<br/>-It may have bugs, but I'm here also to fix them! So, check out 'KNOWN BUGS' section below before reporting.
