Also check if your browser is using version 25 or the latest one. This is a FLASH PLAYER problem, not a GAME BUG.

				 - <b>A faster processor</b> (Pentium Core 2 Duo or higher recommended) . You can surely play it in slower PCs and even mobile phones but you will need to tweak graphic settings (OPTIONS SCREEN in the game), or even overclock your device. The game relies more on CPU speed (MHZ/GHZ) than GPU, as Flash uses almost 100% of its code in CPU.</p>
				<p>- <b>Flash Player 12 up to 25</b> (The recommended version is 12 up to 17, but you can check if the latest versions are better for you). <!--Faster versions is 12, 17 or 21, but be careful about those versions (due to SAVE/LOAD slot bug).

		<h3><span style="color: #000080;">LATEST CHANGELOGs:</span></h3>
		<div class="lingulo-accordion">
			<h5>(You can see the full changelog in 'The Game->THE Changelog' menu)</h5>
			<div>
				<h4>Update 3.47 (30th June 2018)</h4>
					<br/>- NEW: Level 8-3 (Rotten Dessert) made by me.
					<br/>- NEW: Jellyfish scene by Blargh! You can find it if you had the scene in the secret 'sand place' and you keep going in later levels (she will appear in a kyosk near the end of the next level).
					<br/>- NEW: 'Rotten mushroom big'. He's that big mushroom the princess mounts on. That one usually appear in 'dark, rotten areas', like in level 8-3. If she does sex, she will get some side effects, like a bigger belly (if not already big) or drunkness.
					<br/>- NEW: The princess can 'taunt' herself in her mirror next to her bed in Peach's Castle.
					<br/>- NEW: A boot to choose from (shoe types): X-Naut boots.
					<br/>- NEW: Glow gold effect when taking coins.
					<br/>- NEW art: 'grassed dirty floor'. Its in level 4-2.
					<br/>- Added piranha plants in level 7-2, 8-1 and 8-2.
					<br/>- Added Peach with dick variant (futanari) in achievement art, only if 'She can be a futa' is YES in the options. Futa princess is NOT yet in the game, but you can enjoy futa Peach in those art. To turn it off, just put 'she can be a futa' as NO. The plan is to have a true futa princess walking around IF 'she can be a futa' is YES, and a potion or an event TURNED HER into a futa.
					<br/>- Rule change: In 'HARD GAME' mode, 'worldmap 8' pipe wont allow the princess to return to her castle. She is trapped there until finishing the game.
					<br/>- Rule change: In 'HARD GAME' mode, and her boob size is over Size 4 or 5, she can't run anymore (she will be moving slowly) until she her boobs become smaller
					<br/>- BUG FIX: Most of the showers didn't work (tested in normal game mode)
					<br/>- BUG FIX: In a Jabbi scene, the Princess was freezing up (also happened in the gallery).
					<br/>- BUG FIX: The princess is 'immediatelly dropping dead' (flying down) in certain levels like 1-3.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: 'Mushroom Big' scenes not happening anymore.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: First Pokey scene with some abrupt 'changes' like princess' head when subscene1 repeats. Also, its not repeating the same sucking pose many times.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: If you give the Bobomb Buddy a Handjob/Titjob, the peach cannot use the computer. She has to leave the bunker and come back to change levels (tested in normal game mode)
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: If the player reseted the saves, the Gallery and some Achievements weren't reseted. Could not restore a clean game.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: After finishing Level 8-2, the second door of the worldmap broke, but the castle level (endlevel)(8-8) kept enabled = false (if you know what I mean)
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: when in hard game mode, different creatures appear, like Xnauts. The problem is that he's instantly sending the princess to Xnaut lab.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: in hard game mode, whenever a new enemy has sex with the princess, it nearly always pops up saying 'she lost her virginity'.
					<br/>- Other small fixes, like 'no more two lady Bows in certain places in hard game mode'.
				<p/>

			<div>
				<h4>Update 3.46 (24th February 2018)</h4>
					<br/>- NEW scene: Mouser in the prison by Blargh! To see it, you have to lose all your lives two times (so, two 'game overs'). If you keep having 'game overs', Bowser or Bowser Jr will appear there later, then Mouser might reappear in the future. Right in the second gameover, you will lose your virginity if any, so beware!
					<br/>- NEW scene: 'The princess getting paid for slutty services' made by me. This scene is triggered when you find a screen (a wooden clothing changer) in the bars and in certain outside areas of Delfino land. If you're a nymph, you can activate this scene, where you can select which service you will be doing (handjob, boobjob, blowjob, vaginal sex and anal sex). A random creature will then appear to fulfill his desires. Each one will give a certain amount of coins. Be careful, though. In certain times, a creature could be so 'thirsty' they would do a gangbang (but you'll certain earn more coins!)
					<br/>- Rule change: now you will only get the achievement 'Gangbanged in the prison' if Mouser gangbang scene, goomba gangbang scene and Koopa gangbang scene are executed in the prison, so, many gameovers are needed to unlock it.
					<br/>- Rule change: Monty moles wont appear in the prison anymore. That's because there isnt a proper gangbang scene, and even if so, the prison achievement art would be even harder to get from many gangbang creatures.
					<br/>- Rule change: Creatures that open the door in the prison will do a 'gangbang scene' if the princess touches them.
					<br/>- XML i18n: new editable text (Drink billboard and 'The hottest girls for the right place' billboard), as well as the new scenes above
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: "Quick Warp to an Active Level" was showing "Quick Warp to an Active" only, in the load game screen.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: "ERROR in XML" when interacting with the green house near Blacksmith house in Toad Town.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Blueprints not being shown in 'level change screen' anymore (Tech info: wrong 'visible/invisible dup code)
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: The nymph Princess was asking to remove her clothes even if she isnt able to walk, like in the new 'paying for slutty services' above.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: When the princess is nymph and with a chainball in the prison, sometimes she shows her butt to us (butt dance) without the chainball. 
					<br/>- Other small glitches, like certain shyguys not checking if the princess allows Anal sex or not.

		<h3><span style="color: #000080;">DISCLAIMER:</span></h3>
			-This is a XXX freeware parody game of Princess Peach (18+ only)!
			<br/>-It's always good to remember: This is a fan game inspired by PLAYSHAPES game (link <a href="http://swfchan.com/17/84872/?mario-is-missing.swf" target="_blank">HERE!</a>). Without Playshapes vanguardism, this game may never have existed!
			<br/>-This Peach game has NOTHING to do with NINTENDO! Their games are 'E' rated anyway. Although everything was created from scratch/inspired by hentai sites, the names "Princess Peach, Super Mario Bros" and other Mario characters are copyrighted by NINTENDO.
			<br/>- Now the game features 4 (FOUR) keyboard layouts. Please choose one before playing. It also has QWERTY/AZERTY options.  That's better than setting each key separately (a tedious process for you, and not fail-proof to be saved correctly if you turn off the computer, as flash uses internal cache in a ghost file!)
			<br/>-It may have bugs, but I'm here also to fix them! So, check out the ISSUES menu before reporting.
