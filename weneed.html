		<h4>Here you can help us, if you can use Adobe Flash CC</h4>
		<br/>The idea is people helping us with new outfits. We can provide the FLA with all princess poses, so you can design an outfit for her.
		<br/>The outfits needs to be in Mario Universe. One or two outfits will be from other games, like Alice Wonderland (a bonus I tried to make in my free time).
		<br/>So we want to know if someone can help us design one of those:
		<br/><br/>
		[ ] OUTFIT:Lakitu outfit (actually only moving clouds covering her shameless areas, with a Lakitu helmet and green boots)
		[ ] OUTFIT:Alice(body, skirt, bra, apron). 
		[ ] OUTFIT:Tennis outfit
		[ ] OUTFIT:Black Leather/corset dress (with a whip) and fishnet stockings
		[ ] OUTFIT: Poncho (from Super Mario Odyssey)
