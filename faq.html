		<h3>'Peach Untold Tale' FAQ:</h3>
		<div class="lingulo-accordion">
			<div>
				<h4>"What is the plot of PUT (Peach Untold Tale)? Why PUT?"</h4>
				Just access the 'About' menu item or go right <a href="https://ivanaedler.github.io/MIMPUT/story.html">here!</a>
				 <p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"Is it a full featured game?"</h4>
				 Not yet. I will call a full featured one when this game has all the 8 worlds as Classic Mario (plus the special world, total 9!).
				 <p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"What's the difference between a NORMAL and HARD game?"</h4>
				In the hard mode:
				<br/>1) The princess wont masturbate herself if horny or a nymph (even if you press the masturbation key)
				<br/>2) Certain levels will have more enemies, or different (harder) ones
				<br/>3) Creatures like goombas will 'exclamate' (chase you) longer, and they will walk/run/go down faster
				<br/>4) Creatures with spikes/spines (like Spike Goombas and Pokeys) will hurt you even if the princess was leaving a sex scene or right after being warped/used a door in the last second. So if many creatures are touching you, the princess might be fucked over and over until they are laid
				<br/>5) Toads will have more probability to slip their dicks inside the princess pussy
				<br/>6) Creatures will fuck you in a 'random scene mode' (instead of sequential). So a vaginal scene can happen right in the first Shyguy scene, or the second Koopa scene for example
				<br/>7) Fire Princess can throw only ONE fireball at a time (and it will last longer in order for you to be able to throw another one)
				<br/>8) Certain structures like the 'Donut Balanc√©' (the two red platforms where the princess needs to be on top of one in order to make the other go up) will break earlier if you stay on one platform for so long.
				<br/>9) Certain 'safe' powerups blocks have a chance of spurting a Poison Mushroom!
				<br/>10) 50% of 1up mushrooms will be poison mushrooms instead! But beware, it happens very randomly, so you might get 1up three or more times in a row, then poison four times in a row, for example. 50% is the AVERAGE of all punched 1up blocks.
				<br/>11) The princess will require fewer scenes to be a nymph of the level (thus, fewer total scenes to be a nymph of the game).
				<br/>12) More chance to get pregnant, even you put 'LOW' in the options. If low is, say, 10% of chance, it will be now 20%. The same with Medium. In HIGH, she might be pregnant all the time in any vaginal sex! (not with every creature race due to limitations).
				<br/>13) If she is 80% horny or more (horny bar), the princess will get dizzy, so you will walk slower until the effect vanishes.

				<h4>"How's about the CHEATS?"</h4>
				<b>I hope you feel guilty!</b> But I understand if you use them sparingly because of a bug, for example.
				<br/>Bonuses will be disabled and coins/score points will be zero in each level! Here is the board!
				<br/><br/>
						<img src="images/CHEAT CODES.jpg" />
				<br/>=> Levels with BluePrints: Dont need to know anymore, as the current level will inform you when it's loading!
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"How do I unlock the gallery?"</h4> You have to get into lascive situations (aka sex scenes) to many enemies/friends of the same type until you unlock it. If you want to check the gallery sooner, use the cheat key combination in a level (search for the code here in this post) then go to the gallery. There will be a 'UNLOCK' button. Click on it. But remember you are spoiling yourself.
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"The game window is big in my browser screen! Any way to diminish it?"</h4> Just download the SWF and play it in Flash Player Projector (freeware), or Irfanview with Flash plugin. You can resize the window. My plan is to diminish the game area (resolution) in this forum, putting a smaller value. 
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"Will the game have modern references, like Lakitu Cameras, Wario car, Peach Racer bike, airplanes, etc?"</h4> Sorry, no. PUT is a medieval themed game, just like Zelda and the first Mario games. I prefer to retain the correct time lapse and era. If we need a given object, we can have alternatives, like a bird in a cage which can sing like a stereo system, a monocle which makes Lakitu focus and draw anything he is observing, a carriage that acts like a car, or a mushroom dick which acts like a microphone, just like Flintstones cartoons. But actually, we can 'do' see one of other future technology like a webcam, and the 'steam-engined' train itself (where Mario and Peach is in the beginning of the game), but that's due to E.Gadd or Sir Grodus technology, so they will be exceptions to this rule.
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"Are we ever going to see options to make her ass larger like we can with her boobs?"</h4> Yes, but its in a very low priority because of the complexity involved (UPDATE APRIL 2017: TripFlip is making the New TF Peach, so it will support ass sizes better).
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"Are you going to put references from Super Paper Mario and Mario games with Baby Peach?"</h4> Sorry, I cant promise this. The game is centered on SMB1, SMB2, SMB3, SM RPG, SMW, Paper Mario 1 and 2 and a few of Super Mario Sunshine.  The game will have much more of SMB2, SM RPG and Paper Mario 2 refences since its the way I concepted it.
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"This game has text scripts/features that are not perfect/expected! Any plan to fix/improve them?"</h4> Well, provided my real intentions were to put some breaking blocks, only Peach character, poses like swimming and more goomba scenes back in version 1.0j (did you play it already?), I have NOTHING to complain at all, as we have a much better game than that time. If you want to help, just post your opinions :)
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"This game is so big! More than 30mb! Playshapes Mario is Missing was like 5mb or less! Could you please optimize it more?"</h4> I'm really sorry. 80% of this size is due to Mp3 music, hentai art screens and the huge levels. Anyway, there are games with more than 200mb (generally with ogg files and tons of PNG uncompressed images), with 20% or even less of PUT amount of contents. So if you want to play PUT without having to wait in the web page, just download it locally instead of opening it in slow internet connections. And no, I wont be optimizing mp3 even more because the music will start to be noisy/with hiccups. I might create a 'no music' version, which will make the game down to 15mb or less. But dont expect a 2mb game. Not in that kind of immersive game.
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"Is it possible to have a level editor for this game"?</h4> Not feasible to do. The problem is that, in order for us to have the actual game state in a faster time (I know we could have it complete in fewer months, but this is a big game already), in order for that, I needed to optimize code and combine objects in a way we cant edit a given level easily, in a kind of 'SWF level editor' like HumminBird did with his Pokemon games. Not possible because each level uses a very intrincate mechanisms, and I use vectors, not bitmaps (giving a more '3d' and 'continuous' feeling), in a non rectangular way (I dont use tile editing), and some hard code is needed too.
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"Can I join the team/program something/make art/princess voices?"</h4> Of course! You can check 'Help Needed' menu item in this site, or just post in my Patreon site or in Legend of Krystal  forum site. You can directly suggest a feature you want to implement or improve, or you can ask me directly (in the forum or in a personal message), so I'll analyse and then you can work. PUT is in this actual stage because of artists who kindly help over time, so I appreciate all efforts. Joining the team (as a knight) requires rules: 1) Be present in the forum many times a week, participating in the thread and in PMs (messages), that is, be communicative and dont accumulate thoughts you are going to discuss about, avoiding surprises or double work. 2) Be polite, enthusiastic about the possibilities and have a good heart. I work with love, priorizing sexy features. 3) Plase note there might be one or more features I can say 'no', but I will explain why, and you can convince me. I can be wrong too.
				<br/>You dont need to be part of the team to help. You can help, without participating in reunions and chats, and you can quit at any time. People who were in the team, once leaving, will be listed permanently in 'RETIRED', but their chairs will be always there if they return someday. 
				Finally, you can argue with me and convince me of things the game is not right, provided you help on that change (dialogues, sketches, how-tos). Remember I work with dedication and with a goal, in order to make it complete and unicque. 
				If your feature ends up accepted and in the game (be you in the team or not), your name will be in the credits screen.
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"How about that weird MATH screen when I press ENTER?"</h4> This is the PANIC button. Its to protect you from places you're not supposed to play the game (like in your spouse bedroom). To exit it, click CTRL or click with the mouse in the 'X' mark, then go to the options or press '/' (in the keypad) to re-enable the sound.
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"Are you teamed with Blargh (MIM DO version?) I want to see improvements in both versions!</h4> Yes! We are helping each other since 2013. Among Blargh skills, he is a great animator. I am happy to have him with us.
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"Will the game have futa scenes?"</h4> <b>UPDATED</b>: YES but it will be a ON/OFF option. OFF as default. It will be done later in time (low priority).
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"Will the current princess character be able to fuck/molest her breed?"</h4>NOT AT ALL. Not planned, sorry. BUT of course they can arouse the princess (e.g. Lumas sucking her nipples). Any initiation will be done by them and the princess have to respect it to make them happy and at peace.
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"I wanted differend speeds in the scenes (like SLOW, MEDIUM, HIGH), is that possible?"</h4> Yes, but not so straightforward. Making Slow/Normal/Fast will require me coding 'SKIP frames' mode (as flash doesnt support FPS changes directly, in just a given scene). People do like this: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-11-12-13-14-15-16-17-18-19-20 (time lapse of a fucking scene) 1-3-5-7-9-11-13-15-17-19 (CUTTED DOWN timelapse using code) 1-4-7-10-13-16-19 (CUTTED DOWN timelapse using another code). I wanted to do this code based on some resources (games like Meet and Fuck use algorithms like that, who does all the work), but it will make me refactor TONS of scenes and frames (like 300!) because there are code that executes in a given frame: e.g. frame 5. If I skip it to make it faster (say, 1,4,7,11), the princess may not change her eyes, her belly may not change, and the current sexual loop may not happen at all!
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"Will the game have more sex scenes?"</h4>I am ALWAYS updating this one, with new scenes. We got the 300th mark in the beginning of 2017! I planned to perpass 400th, but I am now focusing in world 8 and other features.
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"Can I share this game elsewhere?"</h4>Yes, go ahead. But please link it back to this forum area (in order to get latest updates and bug fixes too).
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"Can I replay a given sex scene with a laid enemy?"</h4>Yes! Just go to the laid enemy and press any number between 0 and 9. Then press the DO-OVER key. Sometimes it may not work when multiple enemies are laid in the same place (obvious reasons) and beware that the princess can only activate, say, the 5th scene, if she has participated in the first 4 scenes! Beware that there are enemies you cannot DO over, like Bloopers, Pokeys and Koopalings.
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"The game is still difficult for me! How can I get more clues?"</h4>Please post a recommendation in <a href="https://legendofkrystal.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=2265" target="_blank">LEGEND OF KRYSTAL</a> forums or post a message in my <a href="https://www.patreon.com/aef22" target="_blank">Patreon site</a>, so I can do something. 
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"Will the game have more playable characters?"</h4>Do you want even more? Krystal was added recently (March 2015) and I may now prioritize levels and enemy/Koopaling scenes until the game is completed! There is a plan to add Mona (from Wario) and Pauline. But I can't promise yet!
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"Will the game have more costumes?"</h4>YES! I'll be putting in slower pace, though. More outfits like Tennis skirt and even 'Alice' dress and should be put when we have all 8 worlds. 
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"Is the source available?"</h4> <b>DISCLAIMER</b>: Not yet. I decided to close it to the team due to unfair distribution of the game without my permission, and worse, altering code in a way they are saying they did the game. An example: 'http://vk.com/app3599709_-14512877'. Its the same guys that want to modify games like Shinobi Girl. So the management of the source now follows the same rules of Space Escape and Pokemon (by Humbird). However, I plan to make small games available (source included), using the same current engine, for LOK members, as well as make collections of resources made by me, available to the public.  
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"Can I use some of its graphics/make a game in other platforms?"</h4> Yes, just ask me for the resources. Then I only ask you to at least indicate they came from here, in your credits screen. And these resources must not be sold by any means!
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"I dont know which key to press in the game!"</h4> Just see the HELP menu (clicking OPEN MENU button or pressing CTRL key)!
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"The current princess is changing all her outfits all the time (blinking bug!)"</h4>You might have an OLD save file. Sorry but, so far, I am updating the game like once per day, so its possible the new variables are not compliant with old saves. I can do nothing to avoid this, sorry. The only way to avoid this is to complete the game first, using your older version, then, after playing it fully, you can upgrade. DONT FORGET TO CLEAR ALL FLASH CACHES before playing the new one.
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"My savegame is disappearing!!"</h4> Check your browser settings. Unfortunatelly, Flash doesnt give me a way to make the savefiles ethernal. They're COOKIES. Your browser control these. Check COOKIE expiration time. If it still doesnt work, right click in the game, then SETTINGS, then put the slider at max. If it doesnt work, please read <a href="http://www.coolmath-games.com/flash-game-progress-erased-deleted-wiped-out.html" target="_blank">THIS</a>. If its offline, try to find 'flash-game-progress-erased-deleted-wiped-out.html' in google. You can also use the 'save to clipboard' feature (green button in the load game screen). Just press it, then go to notepad and PASTE there (CTRL+V), then save it as, say, 'saved_game.txt'. It's an interesting way to retrieve your latest game played. You can have unlimited txt files.
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"The princess doesn't follow my commands immediatelly".</h4> Your computer is slow to play this game. Please use '-' and '=' keys to lower game quality. Also, you can diminish windows size, in case you're using FLASH PLAYER PROJECTOR (go to adobe site and download it. It's faster than in-browse version). You can also use CAMERA FRAMESKIPPING ( * key, in the keypad) and many quality options in the OPTION SCREEN, like the 'Stationary Camera' feature. Finally, you can try using another browser - chrome is faster than firefox). You can also try playing on Internet Explorer, Opera, Safari and even Irfanview Flash Player. Also check if Flash is with Hardware acceleration on (right click in the game -> settings). Sometimes it's a program in the background taking much CPU (so check control + shift + ESC).
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"The game is so slow! How can I improve its speed?"</h4> Please check the header above (The princess doesn't follow my commands). You can also try to disable music (pressing '/' in the keypad or in the game options). And better yet, you can use a standalone Flash Player for free (the name is 'FLASH PLAYER PROJECTOR'), from Adobe, so you can resize the window.
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"When I use RUN key (X), I can't jump or go left/right when I press two or three keys at a same time. It also happens with other keys. It's like it has a limit of keys being pressed".</h4>Its a problem in your system. Normally, all keys are independent. Sometimes, your keyboard brand, WINDOWS operating systems, some keyboard drivers, running programs (TSR/daemons) like Steam and/or a given Flash Player version can cause this problem. You will need to isolate this problem by yourself. Some people got success by just replacing their keyboards.
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"When I jump, a window asking for a bookmark is shown".</h4> Those browsers! :/ That's why I changed jump key from LEFT CONTROL to 'C', and RIGHT CONTROL to K since version 1.24. In the last voting pool, 50 people prefer CONTROL and 25 don't, but those 50 don't use WASD at all. Anyway, at this time, you can choose a keyboard layout before playing!
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"Hey! When I advance / forward / rewind scenes using right click in flash player, the game messes up!"</h4> Right clicking in the game wont show certain items like those anymore, but if it does show up (e.g. you're using another Flash player), you're advised NOT to use it for cheating. Peach Untold Tale (like a lot of flash games) aren't supposed to work that way because the forward mechanism is like removing one game DVD while it is still running and putting a second DVD. Even if its possible, this is considered cheating for those games, and crashes can occur. If you really want to apply cheats, check the cheat list in one of the first headers of this FAQ.
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"The princess is jumping or swimming through walls and ceilings"</h4> In certain rooms with doors, or underwater areas, in some circuntances, the princess can jump/swim through some walls/ceilings. Although the princess does not trespass boundaries (like the roof), which will be considered a major bug if she does, she may trespass some of inner square blocks, mostly if they're diagonal. Its NOT a bug but a limitation, in order for you to play the game with less CPU usage (the game is still heavy in CPU, I know. It could be worse).
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"Blocks don't hit the princess's Head. She jumps through them".</h4> <b>This is a feature!</b> Just play Mario Bros 2 and you will see it uses the same mechanism.  But I've added a collision when the blocks have coins or any powerup. When the princess breaks them or turns them solid, then the princess can trespass them. It's like the princess is a bit at front of the blocks,so you can jump on them better and you are not stuck in small areas, so, more freedom going to places!
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"When I use Daisy or Rosalina, they act like Peach, and many voices are Peach's".</h4> It's a Peach based game,"AFAI" programmed, but I may add Daisy and Rosalina sounds, as well as Daisy and Rosalina traits, that is, Rosalina might avoid all sex scenes, and Daisy would be like a slut (a good 'nymph'), who loves dicks.
				<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h4>"If Peach dies, the level doesn't restart completelly. Laid enemies and destructed blocks are still like that."</h4> <b>It's a feature!</b> A voting system was done, and the vast majority of people prefer this way. If I let the game restart the level completelly upon dying, enemies could be laid again, as well as coins, and even the puzzles and creatures like Toadsworth and certain toads, so these may annoy the player doing all over again. If you want Peach to fuck the same enemies she had laid before, just use DO-OVER key over those apparently dead enemies. Also, CERTAIN powerups will be back if you lose a life. The game was not made to be hard to beat, anyway. Finally, you actually can just end the level by going left or entering the start door (some levels may not have it, and that's on purpose). Or, once visited, you are back to worldmap and you can revisit it!
