		<h4>Here you can help us, if you can use Adobe Flash CC</h4>
		<br/>The idea is people helping us with new outfits. We can provide the FLA with all princess poses, so you can design an outfit for her.
		<br/>The outfits needs to be in Mario Universe. One or two outfits will be from other games, like Alice Wonderland (a bonus I tried to make in my free time).
		<br/>So we want to know if someone can help us design one of those:
		<br/><b>
		<br/>[ ] OUTFIT: Lakitu outfit (actually only moving clouds covering her shameless areas, with a Lakitu helmet and green boots)
		<br/>[ ] OUTFIT: Alice(body, skirt, bra, apron). 
		<br/>[ ] OUTFIT: Tennis outfit
		<br/>[ ] OUTFIT: Black Leather/corset dress (with a whip) and fishnet stockings
		<br/>[ ] OUTFIT: Poncho (from Super Mario Odyssey)
		</b>
		<br/>You can also give other ideas, provided it's from Mario Universe. In order to contact me, just go to my <a href="https://legendofkrystal.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=34&t=2265" target="_blank">LEGEND OF KRYSTAL thread</a> about MIM PUT game.
		<br/>Please be careful of asking me before making those (in the case you already have the FLA) because there is a risk another person is making the same outfit. 
		<br/>Thank you!
