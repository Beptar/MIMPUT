		<h3>About me:</h3>
		<p>I am a common person. I am from South America, I am in my 30's, I am single, and I am not rich, but I love riding a bicycle, computers and programming. As a gamer, I used to play since the era of 386. I loved  doom, duke3d, quake, and strategy games like age of empires and civilization 2.
		But, like most gamers, we want to see something we imagined, or we dreamed about it while sleeping, or we got aroused while mentioning it with friends (*blush*). For example, when we are in puberty, we start thinking about sex, then we have dreams with game characters or cartoons. We then imagine a game with them. So, although I have a normal life, I use some hours to program apps and games that could make people happy.
		At least I dont like 'war' and 'gory' games anymore. GTA5 for example. I prefer sex than war (who wouldn't?). The problem is that the society prefers to censor and ban anything 'shameful', but they allow movies with extreme drama, blood, death and crime.
		Why? Anyway...Those are the reasons that made me decide to make 18+ parody games as a hobby. But I also make E+ (Everyone) remakes, although many of them are demos and I have not finished them yet (they're 'on hyatus').
		<br /><br />Recently (March 2017), I am playing 18+ games that uses RPGMAKER (like Roshutsu and Green Shadow Rachel). I like the concepts of them, as it brings freedom for us to explore the world, then interact with characters often, in order to get new scenes.
		I love Princess Peach (it's my 'waifu' character), and I feel so refreshed and happy that this makes me have creativity to create demos and games for free that explores the sexuality (not only Peach, but other characters too). As I don't like 'extreme fetishes' like scat, gore, 'extreme BDSM', etc (like Agent Alona - Japan Investigation), at least you know you will be playing a more soft game.
		My uttermost dream is to have huge 18+ games that are free and people can explore and play it differently, without getting bored about them easily. Games where you can also customize (an OPTIONS screen full of switches) according to your tastes. And a better forum support, that is, sites where players can give suggestions and feedbacks, so we can improve the game even more, without paying a cent for it.
		<br /><br />
		Since 2016, I created a Patreon site, as I noticed people wanted to donate and help the team indirectly (that is, with coffee, server bills, artist drawings and custom art and code). Although I program for free, for sure we can work even more focused when people appreciate our work. Donation here is like a person that walks in a street, then give a tip to us. We come back home thinking: 'wow, I do something that people appreciate! I will do it better and better'. I follow this phylosophy.
		<br /><br />
		That's it. Thanks for reading.
