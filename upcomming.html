					<h4>I won't make:</h4>
					  - Scat. I am not fond of these fetishes, but I do know people who like it, and I dont care anyway, more because ON/OFF option was possible. However, too many people are against this at all costs, so it wont be coded in MIM PUT in any circunstances. Moreover, Peach is a 'clean' damsel, outside and inside (a perfect woman for ass lovers). However, a 'clean cum fart' (e.g. for her ass/pussy) is feasible.
					  <br/>- Theatre/Audience style 'fight' like Paper Mario 2: I wont make this system neither on PUT or in Cute Peach game. Fights will happen during normal level, right on the spot (scenes). But we could have creatures that can make a crowd there in certain circunstances. And we can have a theatre AREA with an audience but inside a given building, with some local fights there. Sorry about that but I dont like the threatre system in Paper Mario 2.
					  <br/>- Modern electronic objects found in real life, like palmtops, portable consoles, cameras for Lakitu and Wario, cars and motorcycles. This game follows a medieval theme, like Super Mario 1, 2, and Super Mario RPG. They can have classical/magical structures instead, like wooden binoculars and carriages. If modern karts/bikes are present, it should be explict they were E.Gadd or Sir Grodus technology. Sorry about that, I just dont agree of *everything* in a Mario game. The 'non-linear timescale' every Mario game has was the way Mario creators did to give more fun for kids. 
					  <br/>- Certain Mario friends/enemies from newer games like New Super Mario Bros (U) and Super Paper Mario (mostly the unknown ones, not common in older series), and Waluigi (in the case I add Wario). So I wont be just adding friends/enemies until further discussion. People have really to convince me and better if you bring the model with some scenes already, like LuftMallow did with the Anuboo (the black dog from Super Star Saga). The exception is creatures from Paper Mario 2, because I based this game on it too.
					  <br/>- Non Mario Universe creatures like Donkey Kong, Zelda, Pokemon... The only exception is the DK himself ONLY in the case I add a Pauline scene, this being an Easter Egg.
					<br/><br/>Just to remember, I already discussed about these items during these forum pages.
