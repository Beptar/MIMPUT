		<h3><span style="color: #000080;">LATEST CHANGELOGs:</span></h3>
		<div class="lingulo-accordion">
			<h5>(You can see the full changelog in 'The Game->THE Changelog' menu)</h5>
			<div>
					<h4>Update 3.46 (24th February 2018)</h4>
						<br/>- NEW scene: Mouser in the prison by Blargh! To see it, you have to lose all your lives two times (so, two 'game overs'). If you keep having 'game overs', Bowser or Bowser Jr will appear there later, then Mouser might reappear in the future. Right in the second gameover, you will lose your virginity if any, so beware!
						<br/>- NEW scene: 'The princess getting paid for slutty services' made by me. This scene is triggered when you find a screen (a wooden clothing changer) in the bars and in certain outside areas of Delfino land. If you're a nymph, you can activate this scene, where you can select which service you will be doing (handjob, boobjob, blowjob, vaginal sex and anal sex). A random creature will then appear to fulfill his desires. Each one will give a certain amount of coins. Be careful, though. In certain times, a creature could be so 'thirsty' they would do a gangbang (but you'll certain earn more coins!)
						<br/>- Rule change: now you will only get the achievement 'Gangbanged in the prison' if Mouser gangbang scene, goomba gangbang scene and Koopa gangbang scene are executed in the prison, so, many gameovers are needed to unlock it.
						<br/>- Rule change: Monty moles wont appear in the prison anymore. That's because there isnt a proper gangbang scene, and even if so, the prison achievement art would be even harder to get from many gangbang creatures.
						<br/>- Rule change: Creatures that open the door in the prison will do a 'gangbang scene' if the princess touches them.
						<br/>- XML i18n: new editable text (Drink billboard and 'The hottest girls for the right place' billboard), as well as the new scenes above
						<br/>- Glitch Fix: "Quick Warp to an Active Level" was showing "Quick Warp to an Active" only, in the load game screen.
						<br/>- Glitch Fix: "ERROR in XML" when interacting with the green house near Blacksmith house in Toad Town.
						<br/>- Glitch Fix: Blueprints not being shown in 'level change screen' anymore (Tech info: wrong 'visible/invisible dup code)
						<br/>- Glitch Fix: The nymph Princess was asking to remove her clothes even if she isnt able to walk, like in the new 'paying for slutty services' above.
						<br/>- Glitch Fix: When the princess is nymph and with a chainball in the prison, sometimes she shows her butt to us (butt dance) without the chainball. 
						<br/>- Other small glitches, like certain shyguys not checking if the princess allows Anal sex or not.
					<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
					<h4>Update 3.45 (8th January 2018)</h4>
						<br/>- NEW outfit: Shantae by Blargh!
						<br/>- NEW: Mario "Punish" scene (Raffle won by Chase Wager). To activate it, you need to get Mario in the game once it's completed, and you must be a nymph. An option will appear (1 - Get Punished). The princess will be then stark naked as Mario will shred her outfit/powerup.
						<br/>- Glitch Fix: some code in Bowser Jr in order to make him look at the princess and get stomped by her (if on time).
						<br/>- Glitch Fix: 'ArgumentError' when using the binoculars in 7-2 level.
						<br/>- Glitch Fix: Exit pipe of level 7-2 not working (tech info: there were two 'pipestarcoin2' pipes. Names must be unicque to work).
						<br/>- Glitch Fix: 'Inconsistent Story' with random balloons with creatures like Elvin Gadd, Jinx, Charlieton, Bobomb Buddy, Toadsworth, Luigi, 'Big standing Mushroom', 'MIPS the Rabbit', Poochie, Shyguy Gourmet, Wario, Yoshi, Zess Toad, Punio, Mushroom Frog and some bonus scenes. They must talk with the princess (and she must answer them) with the same phrases because they're not general scenes like goomba ones during levels. BUT!! If you activate 'Funny Dialogue' option, SHE (and the creatures) might talk randomly, as these was made on purpose!
						<br/>- BUG FIX: Yux and Jabbi scenes with endless loops or freezing the princess
					<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
					<h4>Update 3.44 (8th November 2017)</h4>
					<br/>- Rule change: two buttons instead of three in the 'swan' scene in the gallery: the problem is that the first button did nothing, as she was already standing in the swan. The third button (now the second) will make her leave then sit on the swan again.
					<br/>- BUGs and Glitches fixes, like the 'flour' and some objects that got duplicated when the princess takes them in her hands, as well as some buttons not working in the gallery
					<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
					<h4>Update 3.43 (30h October 2017) - REUPLOADED - IMPORTANT UPDATE</h4>
					<br/>- Please reload an external XML (english or other) to refresh the language of the game! Use the ones in my <a class="postlink" href="https://github.com/ivanaedler/MIMPUT/" target="_blank">GITHUB</a>. Or you can just click RESET SAVES in the first screen if you dont have saved games and you dont want to mess around the XML files (English only!)
					<br/>- NEW: Bowser Jr scene! To see it, you have to lose all of your lives, then go to the prison for at least 2 times. He might appear in future 'gameovers' there. This scene is also in the Bowser gallery
					<br/>- NEW: Now you can zoom in the gallery! Just select a given scene, then click in any area of the scene. There are 4 zoom modes. If you click more than 3 times, it will go back to default zoom.
					<br/>- ADDED Bobomb Buddy and Luigi scenes to the Friends gallery
					<br/>- ADDED Luma scene 3 to the game (it had only two in the game, but all three in the gallery). Just talk to Lumas and select option 3.
					<br/>- Rule change: Bowser scene in the prison will now happen if you visit there three times. He might appear in future visits there.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Bowser gallery scene was not working anymore
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Music in 1-5 sometimes is duplicated with another song when the princess loses a life or went underwater
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: sometimes in the worldmap, the princess with a chainball was locking herself up (not being possible to move anymore)
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: the checkpoint in levels like 1-1 was not working as a checkpoint (the princess was returning to the start of the level upon losing a lie)
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: when going to bonus toad house level, a blueprint was being shown in the level loading screen, but there isnt any in that level!
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: certain koopalings (bosses) not advancing during scenes, like Ludwig and Wendy, as well as certain enemy scenes like the 5th chuck scene.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: certain Anuboos and 'laid goombas' are with reversed text balloons.
					<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
					<h4>Update 3.42 (24h October 2017)</h4>
					<br/>- NEW: Bobomb Buddy scene. To see it, you have to stomp him, then return to the Bunker (he will be angry)
					<br/>- NEW: In 1-3 level, the toad says you need to fuck the goomba to get the key. If you agree, but you kill a goomba instead (by stomping him, for example), the toad will argue about it. If you lie and he discovers it, he will be sad and he might order you to suck his dick in order not to tell Toadsworth. The other way around will also get a scene, in the case you tell the toad you rather kill him, but end up with a sex scene with the goomba. Idea by Peterpeterpeter and HappyGoomba.
					<br/>- BUG FIX: Poochy scene in the gallery wasnt working.
					<br/>- BUG FIX: Gallery 'Other Enemies' not working (can't click in any scene button)
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: In Daisy palace, Daisy was still being exchanged to the playable character (like a 'selfish scene').
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: Playing as Krystal, a given Daisy scene in her palace (when she sats on Daisy's lap) was without her blue tail
					<br/>- Glitch Fix (technical): Some improvements with 'checkCh(obj,null,false)' was not working well since July 2017. Rollback to checkCh(obj,"Daisy") and other players manually.
					<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
					<h4>Update 3.41 (17h October 2017)</h4>
					<br/>- NEW: A punishment if you refuse the princess to remove her clothes if she is eager to do (happens in situations like when she is a nymph or slut in heat). There are 4 types of punishment if you press 'no': The timer advances 50 seconds, you got dizzy for some time, creatures will walk/run faster until the end of the level, and you will slip down (like walking over a puddle of cum).
					<br/>- Rule Change: the pink dress (located in Peach's closet) will reappear again only if you finish a given world.
					<br/>- Improvement to gallery code (tech info: instances of scene main casted dynamically)
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: lack of neck in some backside poses, like when descending the finish pole as Peachy character
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: the shygirl behind the lemonade stand looks like the princess in a shygirl outfit. She had no green hair as before. The same with Daisy in 2-6 level (dry dry land).
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: not really a glitch, but some people didnt like her 'always opened' mouth as Peachy character, like in frontside pose. After some seconds she will close her mouth.
					<br/>- Other small fixes, like adjustments to her boobies in backside pose. her washing hand that was trespassing her large breasts during bath, inverted eyes in some poses (tech info: the usage of "liddedright","liddedright", as the new eye setup due to new Peachy dont support those combinations like that anymore), etc.
					<p/>
			</div>
			<div>
					<h4>Update 3.40 (14h October 2017)</h4>
					Three months without an update. This has several reasons: my late vacation + some hard-to-fix-bugs + improvements + personal problems (hope all is now okay to keep going).
					<br/>- NEW SCENE: Luigi gloryhole scene made by Blargh! In order to see it, you have to search for a... 'stinky/not in order toilet' in 6-4 (Delfino Island world)
					<br/>- NEW: Princesses Gangbang scene, made by me, idea from ShadowFox! It is the most complex scene to date! You can get it if you fuck Daisy, then Wendy, then you return to your castle and sit in Peach's bed. If you're Daisy, the option wont be available (I plan making the scene work with other princesses, so when Rosalina is available as a NPC, you will be able to fuck her as Daisy, then go to this gangbang scene). You must NOT beat Wendy (by stomping her) in her airship, or you wont see it!
					<br/>- NEW: 'Princess in the Prison' achievement by TripFlip. In order to see it, you need to be fucked by a guard in a gangbang way, that is, if a goomba opens the door, and the scene is the gangbang one (3 goombas). The same with other creatures there.
					<br/>- NEW: 'Princesses and Wendy' achievement by TripFlip. In order to see it, you need to fuck Daisy, then Wendy, then fuck them all in a gangbang scene in her bedroom.
					<br/>- NEW: 'Less Belly' button during showers, like checkpoint showers, tube baths and pools. Now you can decrease her belly there. If Allow Farting is ON, you will hear fart sounds. This button WONT decrease her belly if Peach is already with default Belly, or if her MINIMUM Belly is already big, or if pregnant.
					<br/>- NEW: 'Burn Off' button during shower. It will appear if you're a Fire Peach or a Fire Peach PS. It will return you to normal Peach.
					<br/>- NEW: You can press LEFT and RIGHT during shower/bath scenes to select a given button, then just press space. So you dont need the mouse in those scenes anymore.
					<br/>- NEW Option: 'Bigger Belly when' (single button that changes its text): none, eating, pregnancy, creatures, or all. If you choose any option while pregnant, you will still be pregnant. If 'none' is selected, this will only make your belly at 'min belly size' at all times. If you choose eating, it will only grow when eating certain fruits, and so on.
					<br/>- NEW: 'Call a Toad' option when the princess is sat down in her bed. IN PROGRESS yet (but well it's there so I'll urge myself to make it fully)!
					<br/>- NEW: 'Asshole swollen till...' option, so you can choose the number of days for it to be back to normal (1,2,3,5,10, and 'NEVER')
					<br/>- IMPROVED shower balloons of text. Instead of buttons, you can click right in the names. More room for more buttons!
					<br/>- IMPROVED gravity check for 'hurting the princess' when creatures are falling off grounds (tech info: GRAV 2)
					<br/>- FASTER 'kick' shells
					<br/>- Rule Change: The princess wont lose her asshole status when losing a life, as you now can choose the number of days for it to be back to normal.
					<br/>- Rule Change: Now, creatures will only harm the princess (when falling down while hitting her) in hard game mode. People are complaining that, in normal game, they were being hurt in a way it's harder to avoid.
					<br/>- Rule Change: Now, when going to worldmap, it wont count +1 day. Its like the princess has plenty of time (before or after a level) to do something else before the day ends. This makes the 'day count' better, as it should count in each adventure (in each level). This also avoids problems like 'only having odd numbers' when going to worldmap, then going back to another level.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: The princess was starting the level with a dress (skirt, vest, shoulder top and bra), but she was supposed to be with lingerie only. Also, when losing a life, she remained with her entire pink dress.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: 'Press to Interact' blue button not disappearing after the princess gets into her bath (like in her Castle)
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: the princess was not sleeping anymore after laying down in her bath (when you press 'lay' button).
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: 'vanilla peach' leg in Krystal character.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: when Wario was naked in some bars, he was regaining clothes in the end of his scene.
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: in some toilets behind closed doors, like in 6-4 level (Delfino), even if the princess opens the door, she couldn't use the toilet (Tech info: state needs to be Dict.opened, not "opened")
					<br/>- Glitch Fix: when you configured her Belly in the options (say, to be 'always Bigger'), she was not respecting this in the beginning of the game (only if you lose a life).
					<br/>- Other minor changes, like more room for Achievement screen buttons, and new XML tags, like ALWAYS and SOMETIMES.

		<h3><span style="color: #000080;">DISCLAIMER:</span></h3>
			-This is a XXX freeware parody game of Princess Peach (18+ only)!
			<br/>-It's always good to remember: This is a fan game inspired by PLAYSHAPES game (link <a href="http://swfchan.com/17/84872/?mario-is-missing.swf" target="_blank">HERE!</a>). Without Playshapes vanguardism, this game may never have existed!
			<br/>-This Peach game has NOTHING to do with NINTENDO! Their games are 'E' rated anyway. Although everything was created from scratch/inspired by hentai sites, the names "Princess Peach, Super Mario Bros" and other Mario characters are copyrighted by NINTENDO.
			<br/>- Now the game features 4 (FOUR) keyboard layouts. Please choose one before playing. It also has QWERTY/AZERTY options.  That's better than setting each key separatelly (a tedious process for you, and not fail-proof to be saved correctly if you turn off the computer, as flash uses internal cache in a ghost file!)
			<br/>-It may have bugs, but I'm here also to fix them! So, check out 'KNOWN BUGS' section below before reporting.
